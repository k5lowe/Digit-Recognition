# Digit-Recognition
A neural network-based digit recognition system using the MNIST dataset to classify handwritten digits with preprocessing and visualization (Coursera Project).

## Description ##

This Coursera project is a neural network-based digit recognition system that utilizes the MNIST dataset to classify handwritten digits (0â€“9). The dataset comprises 60,000 training and 10,000 testing images of 28x28 grayscale pixels, each representing a single digit. The project includes data preprocessing, model design, training, evaluation, and visualization, providing a comprehensive pipeline for solving this classification problem.

Key Metrics:
- Accuracy: 97.50%
- Loss: ~0.14

Features:
- Classifies digits from 0 to 9 using the MNIST dataset
- Data Preprocessing:
  - Flattens 3D image data into 2D arrays
  - Normalizes pixel values to the range [-1, 1]
- Neural Network Model
- Model Training
  - Trains the neural network using the Adam optimizer
  - Utilizes Sparse Categorical Crossentropy loss function
- Calculates model loss and accuracy on the test dataset
- Prediction Visualization
  
Technologies:
- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras
- MNIST Dataset
- Matplotlib
- NumPy
